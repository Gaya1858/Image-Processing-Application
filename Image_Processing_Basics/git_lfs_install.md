## Git LFS Install for .ubyte Files

#### If you are working with large files like .ubyte files in Git, you may run into issues with file size limits and slow upload/download times. Git LFS (Large File Storage) is a Git extension that allows you to store large files outside of your Git repository, while still being able to version and track those files.

* To use Git LFS for your .ubyte files, follow these steps:

* 1.Install Git LFS by following the instructions for your operating system here.
* 2.Once Git LFS is installed, navigate to your Git repository and run the following command to initialize Git LFS for your repository:

    ``` 
    git lfs install 
    git lfs track "*.ubyte"
   
    ```

* In the root directory of your repository, create a .gitattributes file and add the following line to it:
    ```
    git add .gitattributes
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add MNIST dataset"
    git push origin main ```
